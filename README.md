## Description

Heros is a collection of commonly and not-so-commonly used hero section layouts that you can use as inspiration for your hero section! Each page/layout was build using ReactJS and SCSS and is built taking responsiveness into consideration (duh, its standard practice now). Publish and deployed on GitHub Pages. 

The future goal is for this to acts as a UI library for developers to simply copy and paste the source code into their projects. This is still in the works. Stay tuned!
